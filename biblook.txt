NAME
       biblook - lookup entries in a bibliography file

SYNOPSIS
       biblook basename [savefile]

DESCRIPTION
       biblook	permits	rapid	lookup	in  a BibTeX bibliography
       database, using a compact binary index  file  prepared  by
       bibindex(1).

       At  the	prompt,	the  user can enter any of the following
       commands:


       ? or h[elp]
	      Display a brief help message.

       f[ind] [not] <field> <words>
	      Find the entries containing the given words in  any
	      field  with a prefix matching the <field> argument.
	      For  example,  `a'  matches   both   `author'   and
	      `address',  and `au' matches `author' only.  If the
	      <field> argument is `-' (or any string with no let
	      ters or numbers), match any field.

	      If  `not'	appears before the <field>, the sense of
	      the search is reversed.  The symbols  `~'	and  `!'
	      can be used in place of `not'.

	      Each  word  is a contiguous sequence of letters and
	      digits.  Case is ignored; accents should	be  omit
	      ted;  apostrophes are not required.  Single charac
	      ters and a  few  common  words  are  also	ignored.
	      There  is	basic support for pattern matching using
	      the characters ? and *, which match respectively	a
	      single  character	and  a	multi-character  string,
	      including the  null  string.   Thus,  `algorithm??'
	      matches  `algorithmic',  `algorithmes',  and `Algo
	      rithmen'; and `*oint*' matches  `point',	`points',
	      `pointer', `endpoint', `disjoint', etc.  However at
	      present patterns beginning with ? cannot	be  used,
	      as the parser mistakes them for a help request.


       and [not] <field> <words>

       or [not] <field> <words>
	      Intersect	(resp.	union)	the results of the given
	      search with the previous search.	Several of  these
	      commands	may  be	combined on a single line.  Com
	      mands are	handled  in  the  order  in  which  they
	      appear;  there is no precedence.	Unlike other com
	      mands, and like `not', these must	be  spelled  out

	      completely.  `&' can be used in place of `and', and
	      `|' can be used in place of `or'.


       d[isplay]
	      Display the results of the previous search.


       s[ave] [<filename>]
	      Save the results of the previous results	into  the
	      specified file.  If <filename> is omitted, the pre
	      vious save file is used.	If no save file has  ever
	      been specified, results are saved in the file spec
	      ified on the command line.   If  no  such	file  is
	      specified,  `save.bib'  is  used.	If the save file
	      exists, results are appended to it.


       w[hatis] <abbrev>
	      Display  the   definition	of   the   abbreviation
	      <abbrev>.


       q[uit]/EOF
	      Quit.

       Several commands can be combined on a single line by sepa
       rating them with semicolons.  For example,  the	following
       command displays all STOC papers cowritten by Erdo"s with
       out `Voronoi diagrams' in the title:

       f b stoc* | b symp* theory comp* & au erdos & ~t voronoi diagrams ; d


ENVIRONMENT
       BIBLOOKPATH
	      Search path for BibTeX database files named on  the
	      command  line.   If BIBLOOKPATH is not set, biblook
	      defaults to BIBINPUTS.  If neither variable is set,
	      the  files  are assumed to be in the current direc
	      tory.
