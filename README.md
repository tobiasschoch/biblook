# Biblook/ bibindex

### Summary

**Biblook** is a program for quickly searching through bibtex files. The simplest thing `biblook` allows you do is find all entries with a certain word in a certain field ("`find author twain`"). Search results can be displayed or saved into another bibtex file.

**Bibindex** is a support program that creates an index file for later use by `biblook`. You run `bibindex` once for each bibtex file you have. The indexing makes searching with `biblook` much faster than using something like grep or emacs.
