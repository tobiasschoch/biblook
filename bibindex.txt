NAME
     bibindex - create a bibliography index file for biblook(1)

SYNOPSIS
     bibindex basename [[-i] keyword ...]

DESCRIPTION
     bibindex creates a compact binary index file from  a  BibTeX
     bibliography  file to permit fast lookup by biblook(1).  The
     basename argument can optionally omit  the  .bib  extension.
     The  output index file will be named with the same basename,
     and extension

     For indexing purposes, a  word  is  any  contiguous  set  of
     letters and numbers, after the following steps:

          0.  Single characters  and  a  few  very  common  words
              ("an", "and", "for", "in", "of", "on", "the", "to",
              and "with") are never indexed.

          1.  Letters are folded to lower case.  Thus,  "Voronoi"
              is indexed as "voronoi".

          2.  All TeX commands, except those in math expressions,
              are  removed,  but their arguments are left behind.
              Thus, "Erd{\H o}ss" is indexed as "erdos".

          3.  All other non-alphanumeric characters are  removed.
              Non-word   characters  inside  {{possibly}  nested}
              braces or dollar signs do  not  delimit  words,  so
              they  may cause unexpected results.  Within braces,
              spaces and  tabs  delimit  components  of  compound
              words,  which  are  indexed  both  as a unit and as
              individual components.  Thus, "{this  example}"  is
              indexed as "this example thisexample".

          4.  TeX commands in  math  expressions  are  considered
              normal  text.   However,  each contiguous string of
              letters and numbers is considered a component of  a
              compound  word.   Thus, "$O(n\log^2 n)$" is indexed
              as "log onlog2n" instead of "on2".

          5.  Apostrophes  and  brackets  are   ignored.    Thus,
              "{\'O}'D{\'u}nlaing" is indexed as "odunlaing", and
              "J[ohn]" is indexed as "john".

          6.  Single  hyphens  separate  components  of  compound
              words.   Thus,  "semi-on-line"  is indexed as "semi
              line semionline".  (Recall that "on" is ignored.)

     bibindex examines the contents of  all  value  strings,  and
     expects  them  to  be well-formed TeX input.  In particular,

     braces, quotation marks, and dollar  signs  should  be  bal-
     anced.

     Errors detected result in a message giving the  line  number
     of the BibTeX entry in which the error was detected, and the
     line number at the point of the error.  Unbalanced braces or
     dollar  signs  can result in large differences between these
     line numbers; in such a case, the error is somewhere in  the
     entry indicated by the first line number.

OPTIONS
     -i keyword ...
         Add keyword to the list of BibTeX keywords that  are  to
         be ignored, along with their string values, in preparing
         the index.  By default, all keyword = "value" pairs  are
         indexed.   Any number of keywords may be specified after
         the -i flag.

ENVIRONMENT
     BIBINDEXFLAGS
          Default list of options, used if and only if no options
          are  given  on  the command line.  The proper syntax to
          ensure that all fields are indexed, even though  BIBIN-
          DEXOPTS is set, is "bibindex basename -i".
