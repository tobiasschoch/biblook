This directory contains bibindex and biblook, programs for fast lookup
in BibTeX bibliography data bases.  They were written by Jeff
Erickson, now at the University of California, Berkeley, with
contributions from others acknowledged in the revision histories in
the *.c files.

These programs have been successfully built with C (and C++, when
available) compilers and tested on these systems for the 2.6 release:

	DECstation 5000		ULTRIX 4.2	gcc, g++
	HP 9000/375		BSD 4.3		cc, CC
	HP 9000/735		HP-UX 9.0	c89, CC
	IBM RS/6000		AIX 3.2		cc, c89, xlC
	IBM 3090/600S-VF	AIX 2.1		cc, CC
	MIPS RC6280		RISCos 2.1.1	cc
	NeXT 68040		Mach 3.0	cc, cc -ObjC, gcc
	SGI 4D/210		IRIX 4.0.5c	cc, CC
	Stardent		OS 2.2		cc
	Sun SPARCstation	Solaris 2.2	cc, CC, gcc, g++
	Sun SPARCstation	SunOS 4.1.3	acc, gcc, g++

The separate PROBLEMS file records problems encountered on some of
these systems.

bibindex converts a .bib file to a .bix file, which is a compact
binary representation of the .bib file containing hash tables for fast
lookup, as well as byte offset positions into the corresponding .bib
file.

biblook provides an interactive lookup facility using the .bix and
.bib files.  It verifies that the file version number and bibindex
version number match its own values, and also compares the file time
stamps so that it can detect whether the .bix file is out-of-date with
respect to the .bib file.  In either case, execution terminates.

Support for command history has been incorporated in version
2.10 of biblook.  See file README.Readline for details.

biblook may provide a more convenient, and faster, way of searching
.bib files than text editors or pattern search utilities like the grep
programs, particularly since it supports boolean operations between
pairs of patterns.

Both programs are documented in UNIX man pages, and the *.txt files
are the output of nroff+col processing of the *.man files, so that
documentation can read even if nroff is unavailable (e.g. non-UNIX
systems, or UNIX systems where it is an extra-cost option).

The programs so far run only under UNIX.  Plans are to investigate the
possibility of making them work on other operating systems.

For very large bibliography files, it may be necessary to change the
type Index_t in biblook.h from "unsigned short" to "unsigned int".
The choice in version 2.4 and earlier of "unsigned short" is suitable
for the SIGGRAPH and TeX User Group bibliography collections
(SIGGRAPH: 6.7MB with 15,400 entries; TUG: 3.9MB with 14,600 entries).
as of June 1993.  Using "unsigned int" increases the size of the .bix
files by 55% (TUG) to 68% (SIGGRAPH).
